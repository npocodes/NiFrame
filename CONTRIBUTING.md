First off thank you for your consideration in contributing to this project.<br> 
The NiFrame system was designed with third party contributions in mind<br> and 
needs them to succeed.
<br><br><br>

<b>What is the best way one can contribute to the NiFrame project?</b>

This is simple, NiFrame needs third party modules to extend its capabilities,<br>
so development of these "mods" is crucial.
<br><br>

<b>What other ways are there to contribute to the project?</b>

NiFrame has never had a good visual style. The default style was created mainly
for testing functionality of the system. Creating clean, new, crisp styles for
NiFrame can greatly help to bring attention to the system and satisfy users visual
needs. 

Another way would be to create new dbAccess classes so NiFrame can interface
with other DBM systems than MySQL.
